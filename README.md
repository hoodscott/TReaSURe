> Teaching REsources At Scotland: a Unified Repository


This Repository is aimed to be the sharepoint for materials relevant to the 4th year project supervised by Quintin Cutts.
The project is split in two interdependent parts:


- Version Control of Teaching Resources: Scott Hood

- Tracking Teaching Resources Nationally: Dimitrios Kykeridis


The current aim of this project is to have the following functionalities:

- A repository of teaching materials
- A way for users to share their experience of using these materials
- A tracking system for the materials to see how they spread
- The ability to evolve new versions of existing materials, either to improve them in some way or adapt them to suit the user's needs.  These new resources could then be added to the repository and used by others.
- A way to allow the users opportunities to interact and assist each other when adapting or using the materials.


DATABASE for the project is too large for the repository.
