		<p> Roy Kilner (1890–1928) was an English professional cricketer who played nine Test matches for England between 1924 and 1926. 
			He played for Yorkshire County Cricket Club between 1911 and 1927, scoring 1,000 runs in a season ten times and taking 100 wickets 
			in a season five times. He first played for Yorkshire as a batsman before being wounded in the First World War. Returning in 1919
			to a team short of bowlers, he developed into a proficient left-arm spinner. His aggressive batting and warm personality made him a 
			popular player with both cricketers and spectators. First chosen for England in 1924, he was the second most successful bowler on the 
			Ashes tour of 1924–25. He was selected during the 1926 Ashes series but dropped for the final Test. Kilner went on several coaching trips 
			to India during English winters, and on one of these, in 1927–28, he contracted an illness; on his return to England, he died aged 37. His
			funeral was attended by over 100,000 people.
