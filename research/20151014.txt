The following are the main points of conversation taken from this weeks meeting:

Remember to write up the critique of the other sites we looked at .

An interesting way of looking at the split of these projects is:
Scott 	- evolve content, involves creators.
Dimitris- track content,  involves users.

This project will hopefully build upon Emilias's work.
We can all share the data, but use it in different ways.

We could define an api to split jobs:
maybe we could use dummy data / stub methods.

We could use separate branches but we would need to be wary of merge conflicts.

We should now be starting to think of separation, and imaging how our own pieces will look / funcion.
We should also begin to think about how we can encourage use.

When writing the dissertation, we should aknowledge each others work.

For next week: html templates and db design
