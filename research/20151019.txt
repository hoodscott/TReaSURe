The following are the main points of conversation taken from this weeks meeting:

We mainly discussed the design of the database this week.

We have to think if we need the parent and/or the children for the version control.
It may be a good idea to have a children table instead of the current recursive plan of looking up parents, then parents, then parents, ...

We discussed django login protocols, maybe we should use 'eldop' external autherntication.
Gerrie has already looked into it, we can ask him if we can't find anything.

For next week: a web template that hints towards the basic functionality, and a slighly improved db design
