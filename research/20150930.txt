The recording of this meeting can be found at research/PLANC Meeting.wav
The following are some key points that were raised during our Rough Requirements Gathering at the Plan C teacher hub at Hyndland Secondary School:

Version Control:
Reluctant to edit other peoples work in case they mess it up.
It feels somewhat cheeky to co-opt other peoples work
Many online sources of materials end up as a large pile of stuff; not all of it is useful.
The teachers felt as if the original should not be overwritten, and that new versions should come with a reasoning for the update (fixing/adapting).

Finding Resources:
Not many people at the Plan C hub had used the materials held on the Plan C website, some used glow (inaccessible to non teachers)
Not many people had used resources from the Plan C site, more likely to use the materials demonstrated at the hub.
Hard to search through the existing repositories for good material.  It would be easier if there were tags for different units/levels, or tags for different types of resources (homework, workshop, presentation), or tags for different languages english/gaelic, visualbasic/python.

Participation:
The barrier to entry has to be low to not discourage people from uploading their own resources.
Also, the review section must also be quick and easy, otherwise people may not bother to complete it.

Content:
Not only presentations and homework sheets as youtube videos are also used as teaching resources.
It is helpful to see the material in action, such as in a video, before using the material to get an idea of how it works.

Tracking:
Currently, each local authority has their own system from tracking professional update.
They have 3 targets a year to reach and they must record any research they do towards them.
Our site could be useful if the teacher's goals were compatible with it.
It is all done through gtcs.org.uk (general teaching council of Scotland)
